	abstract = {Importance
The inverse social gradient in mental disorders is a well-established research finding with important implications for causal models and policy. This research has used traditional objective social status (OSS) measures such as education, income and occupation. Recently, subjective social status (SSS) measurement has been advocated to capture perception of relative social status, but to date there are no studies of associations between SSS and mental disorders.

Objective
To estimate associations of SSS with DSM-IV mental disorders in multiple countries and to investigate whether the associations persist after comprehensive adjustment of OSS.

Design; Setting; Participants
Face-to-face cross-sectional household surveys of community-dwelling adults in 18 countries in Asia, South Pacific, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East (n= 56,085). SSS was assessed with a self-anchoring scale reflecting respondent evaluations of their place in the social hierarchies of their countries in terms of income, education and occupation. Scores on the 1–10 SSS scale were categorised into four categories: low (scores 1–3); low-mid (scores 4 and 5); high-mid (scores 6 and 7); high (scores 8–10). OSS was assessed with a wide range of fine-grained objective indicators of income, education and occupation.

Main Outcome Measures
The Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed 12-month prevalence of 16 DSM-IV mood, anxiety and impulse control disorders.

Results
Graded, inverse associations were found between SSS and all 16 mental disorders. Gross odds-ratios (lowest versus highest SSS categories) in the range 1.8–9.0 were attenuated but remained significant for all 16 disorders (ORs: 1.4–4.9) after adjusting for OSS indicators. The pattern of inverse association between SSS and mental disorders was significant in 14/18 individual countries, and in low, middle and high income country groups, but was significantly stronger in higher versus lower income countries.

Conclusions
Significant inverse associations between SSS and numerous DSM-IV mental disorders exist across a wide range of countries even after comprehensive adjustment for OSS. Although unclear whether these associations are due to social selection, social causation, or both, these results document clearly that research relying exclusively on standard OSS measures underestimates the steepness of the social gradient in mental disorders.},

	abstract = {Background: Severe mental disorders are associated with social distance from the general population, but there is lack of data on the stigma reported by individuals with common mental disorders. Aims: To identify the correlates and the impact of stigma among individuals with common mental disorders.
Methods: Cross-sectional, household interview survey of 8796 representing the noninstitutionalized adults of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. Two perceived stigma questions (embarrassment and discrimination) were asked to respondents with signiﬁcant disability. Health-related quality of life measured by the SF-12, work and activity limitation and social limitation were also assessed.
Results: Among the 815 participants with a 12-month mental disorder and signiﬁcant disability, 14.8\% had perceived stigma. Stigma was signiﬁcantly associated with low education, being married/living with someone and being unemployed. Perceived stigma was associated with decreased quality of life (SF-12 PCS score − 4.65; p b 0.05), higher work and role limitation and higher social limitation.
Conclusion: Individuals with mental disorders are more likely to report stigma if they have lower education, are married, or are unemployed. Perceived stigma is associated with considerably decrease in quality of life and role functioning. Health professionals and society at large must be aware of these ﬁndings, which suggest that ﬁghting stigma should be a public health priority.},

We investigated this issue by examining associations between 5 aspects of SES and adolescent mental disorders., Methods. Data came from a national survey of US adolescents (n = 6483). Associations among absolute SES (parental income and education), relative SES (relative deprivation, subjective social status), and community level income variation (Gini coefficient) with past-year mental disorders were examined., Results. Subjective social status (mean 0, variance 1) was most consistently associated with mental disorder. Odds ratios with mood, anxiety, substance, and behavior disorders after controlling for other SES indicators were all statistically significant and in the range of 0.7 to 0.8. Associations were strongest for White adolescents. Parent education was associated with low risk for anxiety disorder, relative deprivation with high risk for mood disorder, and the other 2 indicators were associated with none of the disorders considered., Conclusions. Associations between SES and adolescent mental disorders are most directly the result of perceived social status, an aspect of SES that might be more amenable to interventions than objective aspects of SES.},

The age when people immigrate shapes the capacity and efficiency at which they learn and use a new language, the opportunities to meet and socialize with a wide range of people, and respond to healthy or stressful environments. We hypothesize that adult subjective social status will be more predictive of health outcomes among immigrants who arrive in the US in mid- to late-adulthood compared with immigrants who arrive earlier. To investigate this hypothesis, data on immigrants are drawn from the US first national survey of mental health among Asian Americans (N=1451). Logistic regression is used to estimate the relationships between adult subjective social status and mood dysfunction, a composite of anxiety and affective disorder symptoms. As predicted, age at immigration moderated the relationship between adult subjective social status and mood dysfunction. Adult subjective social status was related to health among immigrants arriving when they were 25 years and older, but there was no association between subjective social status and mental health among immigrants arriving before the age of 25 years.},

A recent Canadian survey (Canadian Community Health Survey?Mental Health) included this scale, providing an opportunity to describe perceived stigma in relation to diagnosis for the first time in the Canadian general population.Methods:The survey interview began with an assessment of whether respondents had utilised services for an ?emotional or mental health problem? in the preceding 12 months. The subset reporting service utilisation were asked whether others ?held negative opinions? about them or ?treated them unfairly? for reasons related to their mental health. The analysis reported here used frequencies, means, cross-tabulation, and logistic regression, all incorporating recommended replicate sampling weights and bootstrap variance estimation procedures.Results:Stigma was perceived by 24.4\% of respondents accessing mental health services. The frequency was higher among younger respondents ({\textless}55 years), those who were not working, those reporting only fair or poor mental health, and the subset who reported having received a diagnosis of a mental disorder. Sex and education level were not associated with perceived stigma. People with schizophrenia reported stigmatization only slightly more frequently than those with mood and anxiety disorders.Conclusions:Stigmatization is a common, but not universal, experience among Canadians using services for mental health reasons. Stigmatization was a problem for a sizeable minority of respondents with mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders as well as bipolar and psychotic disorders.},

In Ukraine, regional differences have proven to be powerful predictors of mass attitudes and political behavior. But what does the “regional factor” in Ukrainian politics represent? Is it simply the result of compositional effects, or are the regional differences more than just a sum of other demographic factors correlated with geographic divisions? When analyzing regional divisions as an explanatory variable, what are the implications of employing different regional frameworks? In this article, we demonstrate how geographic divisions in the country hold up even when others factors—such as ethnicity and language use—are controlled for. As part of this inquiry, we compare the results of three competing regional frameworks for Ukraine: one with two regions, one with four regions and one with eight regions. While the eight-region framework is uncommon in studies of Ukraine, the decision to examine eight regions is supported by historical, economic and demographic arguments, as well as by the results of the statistical analyses presented in this article. Scholars who have focused on fewer regions in Ukraine may have underestimated the effects of regional differences and missed interesting stories about intra-state variation in Ukrainian attitudes and voting behavior. The results of this study carry important implications not only for the study of Ukraine but also for those interested in intra-state regional divisions across Europe and Eurasia.},

The Ukraine WMH survey is the first psychiatric epidemiologic study in a former Soviet Union country to administer a structured psychiatric interview to a nationally representative sample. Method In 2002, a national probability sample of 4,725 respondents ages 18 and older were interviewed with the WMH version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI). Prevalence estimates, age-of-onset curves, comorbidity, demographic and geographic risk factors, and treatment seeking were examined. Results Close to one third of the population experienced at least one Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) disorder in their lifetime, 17.6\% experienced an episode in the past year, and 10.6\% had a current disorder. There was no gender difference in the overall prevalence rates. In men, the most common diagnoses were alcohol disorders (26.5\% lifetime) and mood disorders (9.7\% lifetime); in women, they were mood disorders (20.8\% lifetime) and anxiety disorders (7.9\% lifetime). The odds ratios for most pairs of disorders were highly significant. Age of onset was primarily in the teens and early 20s. Age, education, and living in the Eastern region of Ukraine were significant risk factors across disorders, with respondents older than 50 years having the highest prevalence of mood disorder and the lowest prevalence of alcoholism and intermittent explosive disorder. Only a minority of respondents talked to a professional about their symptoms. Conclusion Prevalence estimates of alcoholism among men and recent depression among women were higher in Ukraine  than in comparable European surveys. The results argue for the need to develop and implement educational programs focused on the recognition and treatment of mental and alcohol disorders for the general population, psychiatrists, and general medical providers, who are the main source of mental health care.},

The country in transition to market economy is an increasingly important subject for the research on spatial inequality. The existence of regional disparities in the Central and Eastern European countries has been shown in a number of studies, however few analyses have been done on regional inequalities of the post-Soviet countries, and particularly on Ukraine. The present study attempts to identify inequality in regional development in Ukraine and to test for a convergence/divergence process in Ukrainian economic regions. The research focuses on factors such as initial level of economic development, education, and capital investments as important factors of regional development and economic growth. The study employs the cartographic method to depict a pattern of "core-periphery" in economic development in Ukraine.

	abstract = {Background: This study examined (1) disparities in the proportion of persons who accessed a physician for treatment of a diagnosed mental disorder across 17 health regions in Alberta, Canada, and (2) the extent to which regional disparities in physician access could be explained by dierences in regional demographies, population needs, or physician supply. Methods: The study illustrates the use of ecological comparisons for regional health system performance evaluations. Regional characteristics were aggregated from four sources of data: the health insurance registry ®le (population denominators and regional demographies), physician claims data (treatment access), census data (social indicators of population need), and the medical directory of the College of Physicians of Surgeons (physician supply). Results: Regional variability in needs-adjusted measures of access to physician-based treatment services were comparatively small (varying by a factor of 1.6). Models containing adjustments for demography, need, and physician supply explained 41\% of regional variation in access. Of the total variation explained, physician supply explained a smaller proportion (39\%) in comparison to social demography and needs (61\%). Few large regional imbalances were noted when needs-adjusted and supply-adjusted estimates were compared. Only two areas appeared to be underserviced in comparison to their local needs, re¯ecting approximately 6\% of the provincial population. Conclusions: While all three study factors proved important, ®ndings support the broad conclusion that social demography and social risk (a proxy for need) will remain the key determinants predicting access to physician services for treatment of mental disorders in publicly funded health systems.},

We also searched the grey literature, such as government reports, conference proceedings, and dissertations, to source additional data, and we searched datasets from existing literature reviews of the global prevalence of depression and anxiety and reference lists from the studies that were identified. We applied the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting and used Bayesian meta-regression techniques that adjust for predictors of mental disorders to calculate new point prevalence estimates with 95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs) in settings that had experienced conflict less than 10 years previously.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We estimated that the prevalence of mental disorders (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia) was 22·1\% (95\% UI 18·8–25·7) at any point in time in the conflict-affected populations assessed. The mean comorbidity-adjusted, age-standardised point prevalence was 13·0\% (95\% UI 10·3–16·2) for mild forms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder and 4·0\% (95\% UI 2·9–5·5) for moderate forms. The mean comorbidity-adjusted, age-standardised point prevalence for severe disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression, severe anxiety, and severe post-traumatic stress disorder) was 5·1\% (95\% UI 4·0–6·5).

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate trends in the national and regional reporting of syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia, genital herpes, trichomoniasis, and HIV in Ukraine.
Methods: Annual notification rates of infection per 105 population in three regions of Ukraine—Donetsk, Mikolaiv, Chernivtsi—and also among children, adolescents, and pregnant women were used as indicators for the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the Ukraine from 1994 to 2000. The estimates were based on a review of medical literature, reported data from STD clinics, and local epidemiological surveys. An analysis of the trends was made.
Results: The notification rate of trichomoniasis rose from 284.3 in 1997 to 330.8 in 2000. The same for syphilis was 68.7 per 100 000 population in 1994 peaked in 1996 with 150.9 falling to 91.5 in 2000. The reported incidence of gonorrhoea has been falling recently to 52.7/105 in 2000 (a 104.6\% decrease since 1994). Chlamydia notification rates, however, rose 2.4-fold between 1995 and 2000 (16.1/105 to 54.2/105). In the same period there was a 218\% increase the reported incidence of genital herpes. STIs are more common in the eastern industrial regions. In the period 1994–7 there was a dramatic 179-fold increase in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS which has plateaued in subsequent years. By January 2001 a total of 36 600 cases of HIV infection (including 2040 people with AIDS) have been reported. The proportion of HIV acquired through injecting drug use is falling (72.7\% in 1997 to 54.2\% in 2000) in relation to that acquired through sexual contact.
Conclusions: STIs and HIV are a common cause of morbidity in Ukraine.},

The principal conclusions are: 1. The frequency of suicide in the Ukraine is relatively high (24 per 100,000). The rate of suicide is much higher in rural areas than in the cities. The frequency of completed suicide is not the same in different regions of the country. 2. Sociopsychological processes in the post-totalitarian society have resulted in the development of the “Soviet syndrome” in the population. 3. Suicidal behavior in the post-totalitarian society exists in a special social, psychological, and cultural context that creates obstacles for its effective prevention. 4. Research on the level of suicide knowledge revealed a high prevalence of mythical ideas, even in those groups of the population or professional groups that should be directly involved in education and participate in suicide prevention. 5. An assessment of the attitude of the respondents toward suicide revealed an ambivalence of their feelings and attitudes that could have a negative influence on their practical involvement in helping to deal with suicidal clients.},

	abstract = {Introduction: For decades, the image of mental health in Soviet countries has been associated with past political abuses in psychiatry, stigmatising attitudes and discriminating practices against people with any form of disability. Twenty years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the tainted reputation of psychiatry still persists. Living conditions in mental hospitals remain poor, sometimes inhumane and treatment of people with mental health problems is still marked by paternalistic, disempowering, even abusive practices. The Soviet practice of hiding people deemed disabled translates nowadays into the practice of relocating people with the most severe mental illnesses from mental health hospitals to social care institutions, outside the jurisdiction of the health sector, and outside the scope of mental health reforms.Size of the problem. Morbidity rates from mental health problems in former Soviet countries are similar to those in other European countries. But suicides rates are the highest in Europe, particularly among men, despite decreases since 2000.Resources and organisation. Mental health expenditures account for only three percent of health budgets, in these countries, mostly spent on large psychiatric hospitals. Former Soviet countries have similar organisations of services, but the Russian Federation, Belarus and Kazakhstan report significantly higher resources (services and staff) than the other CIS countries. A contributing factor is the migration of staff from lower income economies, facilitated by similarities between the education and health systems, and fluency in the Russian language.Reforms of specialist services. Besides the development of policy and legislation, progress in implementing reform priorities can be traced mainly to projects that benefited from expert and financial support from international partners. Namely: setting up pilot mental health centres, advocacy for human rights of patients and building capacity in primary care.Mental health in primary care. Introducing mental health services in primary care is challenging due to limitations in roles of primary care staff, but also in their competencies and skills, and their reluctance to take on more responsibilities.Conclusions. With reforms in the early stages of implementation, and slim prospects of suitable resources for necessary developments, modern mental health services remain largely out of reach for most people in former Soviet countries in the near future.},

	abstract = {We review the evidence on effectiveness of interventions for the treatment and prevention of selected mental disorders in low-income and middle-income countries. Depression can be treated effectively in such countries with low-cost antidepressants or with psychological interventions (such as cognitive-behaviour therapy and interpersonal therapies). Stepped-care and collaborative models provide a framework for integration of drug and psychological treatments and help to improve rates of adherence to treatment. First-generation antipsychotic drugs are effective and cost effective for the treatment of schizophrenia; their benefits can be enhanced by psychosocial treatments, such as community-based models of care. Brief interventions delivered by primary-care professionals are effective for management of hazardous alcohol use, and pharmacological and psychosocial interventions have some benefits for people with alcohol dependence. Policies designed to reduce consumption, such as increased taxes and other control strategies, can reduce the population burden of alcohol abuse. Evidence about the efficacy of interventions for developmental disabilities is inadequate, but community-based rehabilitation models provide a low-cost, integrative framework for care of children and adults with chronic mental disabilities. Evidence for mental health interventions for people who are exposed to conflict and other disasters is still weak—especially for interventions in the midst of emergencies. Some trials of interventions for prevention of depression and developmental delays in low-income and middle-income countries show beneficial effects. Interventions for depression, delivered in primary care, are as cost effective as antiretroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS. The process and effectiveness of scaling up mental health interventions has not been adequately assessed. Such research is needed to inform the continuing process of service reform and innovation. However, we recommend that policymakers should act on the available evidence to scale up effective and cost-effective treatments and preventive interventions for mental disorders.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution of Eastern European suicide mortality both before and at the end of the Communist period, as well as the changes that occurred during this period. Regional data on suicide mortality were collected from Czarist “European Russia” in 1910 and from the corresponding area in 1989. The distribution of suicide mortality was mapped at both points in time. Regional continuity over time was further studied with the help of geographical units specially constructed for this purpose. In 1910, suicide mortality was found to be high in the northern Baltic provinces, in the urban parts of north and central Russia, the more urbanized parts of northern and western Poland, in east Ukraine, and in the northern Caucasus, while suicide rates were generally low in south Russia, Dagestan, and in southern Poland. In 1989, suicide mortality was highest in the Urals, the east Russian “ethnic” areas, and in southeast Russia. The rates were low in Poland, Moldavia, and in most of the northern Caucasus. The across-time analysis using specially constructed comparison units showed that the spatial distributions of suicide mortality in 1910 and 1989 were not correlated with each other. Additional analyses pointed to a short-term consistency of regional patterns both in the 1900s–1920s and the 1980s–1990s. The lack of regional continuity in suicide mortality in the area may imply an absence of strong and continuous regional cultures, or a strong influence of other factors, such as societal modernization, on suicide mortality. Suicide as an act changed its social nature during the Communist period, becoming more normal, and more equally distributed among social classes and geographical locations.},

	abstract = {Ethnicity became an important issue in Central Europe in the 19th century. One of the main reasons why multinational states like Austro-Hungary disappeared a century later was the ethnic issue, which was never fully solved by the Hapsburg, Austro-Hungarian authorities. This led to a deeper and more complex movement, the national movement. However in more cases different groups, communities, which considered themselves as being distinct ethnic groups or nations, were not able, due to different reasons, to create a separate state, which would serve as a heaven for their ethnic/national aspiration. This was the case of Ukraine, a nation that was not able to obtain its national sovereignty at the beginning of the 20th century. Today's Ukraine is not an ethnic monolith. Many different ethnic groups are part of Ukraine. Among those groups one has a particular standing. The Rusyn minority is different from the other ethnic minorities living in Ukraine, due to its political status primarily, and due to the majority-minority relation between the Ukrainian central institutions and the regional institutions in Transcarpathia.},
